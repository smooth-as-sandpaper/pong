# pong
Recreated the arcade game Pong using the DE1-SoC FPGA. The game receives input from two players using a PS/2 keyboard connected to the FPGA and is displayed on a VGA-compatible monitor. The game is played until one player reaches a modifiable maximum score, at which point the game can be reset using a switch on the FPGA.
